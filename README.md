## 🚀 Hi, I'm Ryan!

I'm a full-stack developer based out of London, UK.

I started writing code ~13 years ago, and I've had the pleasure of working on applications of all shapes and sizes.

Right now I primarily work in the world of Typescript / React, and sometimes dabble in C++ and Python (now consciously avoiding PHP, of which I've got **_many years_** under my belt).

### 📋 What am I working on now?

Mmm, lots of things. I suppose we'll have to wait and see.
