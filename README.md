## ðŸš€ Hi, I'm Ryan!

I'm a full-stack developer based out of Istanbul, Turkey.

I started writing code ~13 years ago, and I've had the pleasure of working on applications of all shapes and sizes.

Right now I primarily work in the world of Typescript / React, and sometimes dabble in C++ and Python (now consciously avoiding PHP, of which I've got **_many years_** under my belt).

### ðŸ“‹ What am I working on now?

I'm the CTO of a startup in the fintech space, and I've just started out creating content to help new software engineers.
