## ðŸš€ Hi, I'm Ryan!

I'm a full-stack developer based out of London, England.

I started writing code ~13 years ago, and I've had the pleasure of working on applications of all shapes and sizes.

Right now I primarily work in the world of Typescript / React, and sometimes dabble in C++ and Python (now consciously avoiding PHP, of which I've got **_many years_** under my belt).

### ðŸ“‹ What am I working on now?

I've just finally got around to creating my own presence on the web, which I've chosen to build using Remix. Outside of that, I'm working on learning Rust.
